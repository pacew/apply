================================================================

Select an application type:

Dance band,
Caller/dance leader,
Folk music/song/etc.,
Morris/wrapper/etc. dance performance, or
Other dance performance.

Event Description should go after application type so that dance bands don’t have to write one.

For dance bands and callers: Are you primarily
app number start letter
L “American (contra/square)”,
D “English,”
D “Other couples dancing,” or
M “International, line, or circle dancing.”
G Morris/wrapper/etc dance performance
D "other dance performance"



Enter an event title and description (unless they are a dance band)
Select up to one named group that is performing, and see group members in selected group
If a group is selected, their name will be listed as the event performer. If not, applicant name will be listed.
Create a new group if none exists in database.
LOWER PRIORITY: propose to add or remove members from their new or old group.
Note that they will get the chance to do this again later!
Choose any number of individuals that are also performing
These performers will not be listed unless mentioned in event description
CONCERN: Group membership will be listed in the database and can be changed by performers. Extra individuals, however, will be listed only on the application and therefore cannot be added or removed by performers — they will have to contact us to remove an individual from their performance or add an accompanist
POSSIBLE RESOLUTION: Application data is treated like database data — it can be updated by performers and re-downloaded by program committee.
POSSIBILITY NEEDING FURTHER DISCUSSION: If no group is listed but individuals are added, applicant can choose whether to be billed under individual name, duo names, or individual name “and friends.” All of these options, and names of individuals applying to perform solo, are recorded as “group name” on application. All additional individuals are recorded on application.


NOTES:  
Additional equipment comments (no guarantees)
Performers should let us know if there are duplicate entries!
