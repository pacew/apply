Thank you all for agreeing to beta test the NEFFA performer application form.  It was a while ago when I first asked you, but it wound up taking a while to finalize it.  It's ready to go now, and if you still have time, I would appreciate it if you could submit one or more test applications before Friday.

The first thing to know is that whatever you enter in this test period will be deleted, so if you are really applying for anything this year, you'll need to do it again in September on the real site.

For your test, please imagine a specific event, maybe one that you are going to apply for this year, or one that you applied for in the past. Then, answer the questions and see if there's anything that's too confusing.  Please use your real name and email address so I'll be able to get back to you with questions if I see anything weird on my end.  If you have time and interest in testing more than one event type (solo performance, teaching seminar, staged dance presentation, etc), please do so - it is fine to use the same name and email address on more than one application.

After you've finished, the system will email you a confirmation message that will include a link where you can review your responses.

Please email or call me to tell me about your experience.  We can't make structural changes at this point, so I want to concentrate on finding out if there are places where we should add clarifying text, as opposed to general usability suggestions.  We do plan to evolve this process in the coming years, so we'll ask for suggestions for larger changes at the end of this application season.

Hopefully, you won't see any error messages displayed, but if you do, please take a screenshot and email it to me.

The link for the application form is:

Thanks very much!
