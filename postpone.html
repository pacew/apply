<p>Greetings, NEFFA community!</p>


<p>We are delighted to announce that applications are now open for NEFFA
2022, our 78th year! The Festival will be held April 22-24,
2022. Application deadline is October 17, 2021 at 11:59 pm.</p>


<p>As of September, the Board is continuing to plan for an in-person
Festival. The Board is committed to a safe Festival and is actively
discussing policy for vaccination, testing, masks, social distancing,
and other safety protocols.</p>


<p>We expect to make a decision no later than January 1, 2022 on
whether to hold the Festival in person. If the in-person festival is
cancelled, we will pivot to holding an online Festival. Applications
include a question on whether performers are applying for in-person,
online, or both. Either way, we encourage you to apply now, so that we
can put together the best program as soon as possible after January
1.</p>


<p>When making your decision to apply for in-person, applicants should
assume that vaccination and safety measures will be in place. NEFFA
has no plans to attempt a hybrid Festival, so if the Festival goes
forward in person, online-only applicants would not be on the program,
and vice versa.</p>


<p>If held in person, the Festival will be held at the Best Western
Royal Plaza Hotel &amp; Trade Center, 181 Royal Plaza Dr West,
Marlborough, MA 01752. For more information about our new venue,
please see <a target='_blank' href='https://www.neffa.org/neffa-2022-festival-site/'>

<p>On behalf of the Program Committee and the NEFFA Board, we extend
our heartfelt thanks for your support for this wonderful folk
tradition that is the Festival.</p>

<p>Enthusiastically yours,</p>

<p>Lynn Noel<br/>
NEFFA Program Chair</p>
