<p>Dear NEFFA Community,</p>

<p>It's hard to postpone the thought of dancing and singing together
for even a moment longer, but on the eve of opening applications for
NEFFA 2022, the Board and the Program Committee find ourselves deep in
reflection and discussion of whether and how it will be possible and
practical to hold a safe and joyful Festival in person next April.
</p>

<p>
Rather than opening applications today, we are taking an abundance of
caution and pausing until our next Board meeting on September 12. This
does not necessarily mean we will not open applications, merely that
we want to make sure that the Board and Program Committee have the
time for group discussion and careful consideration of a wide range of
options. Rest assured that we have a review process in place that
includes legal and medical advice as well as consultation with the
huge core community of volunteer leadership that makes NEFFA possible.
</p>

<p>
Please hold your applications in patience and expect further
communication from NEFFA shortly after September 12. We will adjust
deadlines as needed when we know more. We appreciate your affection,
care and concern for all members of our community of dance and song.
</p>

<p>
Thoughtfully yours,
<br/>
The NEFFA Program Committee 
</p>
