If a non-logged in user visits the link directly to the application page, they are redirected to the login screen, and then taken to the requested application. 

evid's always have a suffix (such as M123a)

There's a flag near the bottom of the application for "Do Not Import" (also known as "Suppress").  Such applications are omitted from the csv download. 

New fields are available to logged in committee members at the bottom of the application.  (The "C_" prefix will be used for future committee fields)

C_extra_checks
C_notes
C_rejection_reason
C_rejection_notes

The old "online only" cvs column is replaced with "app_link" which is the direct link to edit the application (forcing the user to login first, if necessary).

The system no longer sends email when you save edits to an application.

There's a new "technical documentation" page, linked to from the admin menu.  Mainly intended to record things that Jonathan Young use when connecting with apply.neffa.org.

Changes to the applications list:

* The evid is displayed

* The "ts" (timestamp) column is now "Subtmit date"

* The first line of the C_notes field is displayed.  If the note is more than one line long, a [more] link is included.
