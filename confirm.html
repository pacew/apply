<p>Dear [[[first_name]]],</p>

<p>We have processed your NEFFA [[[festival_year]]] application for
[[[title_for_confirm]]]. Thanks so much for your interest in performing at the
Festival! (You should receive this email once for each application you
submit.)</p>

<p>The next step is to <strong>review your contact information! Your access
code is [[[pcode]]]</strong> See instructions below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>HAVE I BEEN ACCEPTED?</p>

    <p>Programming decisions will be made over the next few
      months. You should be hearing from us in December or January. If
      you have not heard from us by January 15, [[[festival_year]]], 
      please email me
      right away, and let me know.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>WHAT DO I DO NOW?</p>
    
    <p>IMPORTANT: You MUST review your contact data and make any
    necessary changes; the Program Committee will no longer make these
    changes for you. This information appears on our website and in
    our Program Book, and it is what we use to communicate with
    you. If you are contact for a group, your list of group members
    needs to be up to date, since we use this list in order to avoid
    performance time conflicts for your members.</p>
  </li>
    
  <li>
    <p>HOW DO I ACCESS MY CONTACT DATA?</p>

    <p>Go to the following link: 
      <a href='http://webdata.neffa.org'>
	http://webdata.neffa.org
      </a>
    </p>

    <p>
      and enter your access code: [[[pcode]]]
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Read all the boxes and make changes as necessary.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      You may choose to change information about you as an individual,
      and/or you may choose to change information about any or all of
      your groups.
    </p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      Type the changes in the boxes, and make sure that you click on
      the "submit" button. The new or changed data will be put into
      the database automatically. The exception is the member names,
      it will take a few days to see these changes.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      All groups past and present will appear when you enter your
      access code. Feel free to make appropriate changes to any of
      these groups. Please let me know if any of these groups no
      longer exist, so that we can change their status to "inactive".
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      WHAT IF I NEED TO MAKE CHANGES LATER?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Please save this email so you can reference it later. The link
      above and your access code will stay the same from year to year,
      so updates can be made at any time. These changes will
      automatically appear on the website.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
  
<p>
  Please let me know if you have any questions.
</p>

<p>
  Sincerely,<br/>
  Lynn Noel<br/>
